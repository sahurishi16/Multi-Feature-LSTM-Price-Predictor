# 📈 Stock Price Predictor (NSE) using LSTM

This project is a deep learning-based stock price prediction system that forecasts **next-day Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume** for any **NSE-listed stock** using historical data from Yahoo Finance.

It uses **LSTM neural networks** to analyze the past 60 days of stock data and generate accurate predictions for the following day.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts **Open, High, Low, Close, Volume**
- Supports **any NSE stock symbol** (e.g., `RELIANCE.NS`, `TCS.NS`)
- Uses **last 60 days** of historical data
- Built using **PyTorch**, **yfinance**, and **scikit-learn**
- Clean, modular code for training and inference
- Optional **Streamlit UI** for user interaction
